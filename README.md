# reaching-planner
===
## Synopsis
- **`reaching-planner`** is a solution to generate a motion plan for an arm of the iCub, based on the Incremental Sampling-based Algorithm (RRT*)[1],[2]

- A path plan includes the End-effector and the mid point in the Forearm (middle of Forearm), generated by trigger from rpc command.

## Commands
- By sending commands through yarp rpc port, we can trigger the planner to generate a plan based on the environment perception
i.e: `yarp rpc /reaching-planner/rpc:i`
- Command for replan: `replan <deadline>`, with `<deadline>` is the maximum exploration time of each planner
